Project 1: Inidan Agriculture Crop production Analysis

Tool Used :  "Power Bi"

Step 1 : ETL (Export, Transform & Load)
  
  • Data Export and Transformation:

        •	I exported the dataset to Power BI (utilizing Power Query) for data transformation.
        •	During exploration, I identified several missing and null values in the date column.
        •	Notably, consecutive missing cells followed a sequential pattern, allowing us to fill them down from the top cell.
        •	In the “Season” column, unique values represented summer, winter, and autumn.
        •	To maintain consistency, we replaced these values with the corresponding crop season months.


step 2 : Data Visualisation

 • Key Measures and Visuals:
    
        •	We introduced essential measures, including total production, yield per hectare, total crops, and total agricultural area, displayed in cards for quick analysis.
        •	Our visualizations included slicers, line charts, pie charts, bar charts, and text boxes.
        •	We thoughtfully arranged these visuals to enhance understanding and insights.


step 3 : Insights
 
 • Dominant crops and States
 
        •	Rice and Wheat are the dominant crops in terms of both production and area cultivated, crucial for India’s food security.
        •	Punjab and Haryana are key for Wheat production, while West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu lead in Rice production.
        •	Crop production varies significantly by season, with Kharif (58.9%) season seeing high production of Rice, Maize, and Pulses, and Rabi season dominated by Wheat and Barley.
        •	Crops like Sugarcane have the highest yield per hectare due to high biomass, while Rice and Wheat have moderate yields with regional variation.
        •	There has been a shift from traditional cereals like Millets to more profitable crops like Wheat, Rice, and Cotton, driven by market demand and government policies, raising concerns about food security and biodiversity.
        •	Punjab and Haryana exhibit higher productivity due to advanced agricultural techniques, while Bihar and Uttar Pradesh lag behind, indicating the need for improved farming practices and infrastructure.
